This text contains the methodology used to generate and analyze forecasts, as well as a brief overview of the function of each notebook.

1. PREPROCESS_AND_SMOOTH
This notebook converts daily predictions to weekly mean and smoothes trap data using a 3wk moving average.

Results are stored in data/Raw and data/Smoothed.


2. CALCULATE_METRICS
This notebook calculates the overall metrics, interval metrics, and scaling ratios. It does this for the nn predictions generated using the real weather data and the airport weather.
 
Results are stored in output/mean_metrics.csv and in output/amt_metrics/. 


3. CALCULATE_COVERAGES
This notebook scales and forecasts for each day with data available. Then calculates the confidence intervals for 1-\alpha=0,0.1,...,0.99. Finally, reports whether the trap data point for each week in the forecast was captured by the confidence intervals.

Results are stored in output/coverages/.


4. MEAN_METRIC_FIGURES
This notebook produces figures associated with the mean metrics (stored in mean_metrics.csv):
-justify scaling window by showing RMSE for varying scaler windows 
-show the average RMSE for baselines, forecasts with local weather, and forecasts with airport weather

Results are stored in output/metric_figures/.


5. INTERVAL_METRIC_FIGURES
This notebook produces a figure comparing the RMSE scores for the whole-year forecast to the 4-week interval RMSEs.

Results are stored in output/metric_figures/.


6. COVERAGE_FIGURES
This notebook produces a figure showing the coverages of all locations for local weather and airport weather.

Results are stored in output/metric_figures/.


7. REPRESENTATIVE_FORECASTS
This notebook produces the representative forecasts for all locations, showing high and low skill forecasts generated with local weather and airport weather.

Results are stored in output/metric_figures/.


8. MISC_FIGURES
This notebook contains code for miscellaneous figures:
-scatter plot of abundance curves generated using local weather and weather from the San Juan Airport
-comparison of local weather versus San Juan airport weather
-time evolution of $p_w$ and $n_w$ over time
-comparison of scaling ratio for baselines and forecasts for local and airport weather

Results are stored in output/misc_figures/.
